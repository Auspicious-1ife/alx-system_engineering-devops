### Postmortem Report: Nginx Configuration Error

#### Issue Summary
On August 14, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM (GMT), our web application experienced significant downtime, affecting approximately 85% of users who encountered 502 Bad Gateway errors. The root cause of this issue was a typo in the Nginx configuration file, specifically in the upstream server IP addresses. This error prevented Nginx from properly routing requests to the application servers, leading to widespread service disruption.

#### Timeline

- **10:00 AM:** Monitoring systems flagged a surge in 502 errors across the platform. Alerts indicated a problem affecting user access to the application.
- **10:05 AM:** On-call engineers began their investigation, initially focusing on the application servers to determine if they were the source of the issue.
- **10:15 AM:** It was confirmed that the application servers were up and running, but no traffic was being routed to them. This pointed to a potential issue with the Nginx configuration.
- **10:30 AM:** Investigation was redirected to the Nginx configuration. Recent changes were reviewed, including modifications to the upstream server settings.
- **11:15 AM:** Engineers identified a typo in the upstream server IP addresses within the Nginx configuration. This typo prevented Nginx from correctly routing incoming requests to the application servers.
- **11:30 AM:** The incorrect IP addresses were corrected in the Nginx configuration file. Engineers reloaded Nginx to apply the changes.
- **12:00 PM:** After reloading Nginx, normal traffic flow was restored, and users regained access to the application.
- **12:30 PM:** The incident was fully resolved. Monitoring confirmed that the application was stable and functioning correctly.

#### Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:** The outage was caused by a typo in the upstream server IP addresses specified in the Nginx configuration file. This error led to Nginx being unable to route traffic properly, resulting in 502 Bad Gateway errors for users.
  
- **Resolution:** The issue was resolved by correcting the typo in the Nginx configuration file and reloading the Nginx service. This action restored proper routing of requests to the application servers, resolving the error and returning the service to normal operation.

#### Preventative Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

- **Configuration Reviews:** Establish a more rigorous review process for changes to Nginx configurations. This will include mandatory peer reviews to catch potential errors before they are deployed.
  
- **Automated Validation:** Develop and implement automated tools to validate Nginx configuration files for syntax and routing errors. These tools will help ensure that configurations are correct and reduce the risk of human error.

- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Improve monitoring systems to provide more detailed alerts on Nginx routing errors and upstream server issues. This will allow for quicker detection and resolution of similar problems in the future.

- **Training:** Update and expand training materials to include best practices for Nginx configuration and common pitfalls to avoid. Provide additional training sessions for engineers to ensure they are aware of these best practices.

#### Action Items

1. **Implement Peer Reviews:** Enforce a peer review process for all Nginx configuration changes to ensure accuracy and prevent errors.
2. **Automate Configuration Checks:** Integrate automated validation tools to check for common configuration errors before deployment.
3. **Upgrade Monitoring Systems:** Enhance monitoring to include detailed checks for Nginx routing and upstream server health.
4. **Revise Training Programs:** Update training materials to cover common Nginx issues and best practices, and conduct additional training sessions for engineers.
